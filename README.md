## Description

The **Recipe Sharing API** project aims to create a platform where users can share, discover, and collaborate on various recipes. The project is divided into frontend and backend components. While the current state includes the frontend part, the backend development using Python is planned for the near future.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

1. **README.md:** The main documentation file providing an overview of the project and its components (you're reading it now!).
2. **index.html:** The main HTML file for the frontend interface.
3. **recipe.html:** An HTML file for displaying individual recipe details.
4. **recipe1.jpg:** An image file representing a sample recipe.
5. **recipe2.jpg:** Another image file representing a different recipe.
6. **script.js:** JavaScript file containing frontend logic and interactivity.
7. **styles.css:** Cascading Style Sheets file responsible for styling the frontend components.
8. **.gitignore:** Specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
   
## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/botzaifa/Recipe_Sharing_API.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```
   cd Recipe_Sharing_API
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the frontend interface.

## Usage

The current state of the project allows you to explore the frontend interface, view sample recipes, and experience the overall look and feel. The backend, which will be added in the future, will enable users to create, read, update, and delete recipes.
